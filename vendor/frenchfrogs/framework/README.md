Framework - Classes de FrenchFrogs

#Concept
First, we are not sure about the "Framework" part of this library, we just need some developpers tools to ficus hard work on functionnal feature. We don't want to write lines and lines of code to do the same thing.
Sure, some featgure are already in recent framework but they ar often limited and don't respond to a daily use developper concept.

#Polliwog

The simpliest way to explain what we call a polliwog is : it's like MVC but for technical issues.
A pollywog is a polymorphic class that use Frenchfrogs models and renderer when it need it and to do it we use "Trait" php fonctionnality.
